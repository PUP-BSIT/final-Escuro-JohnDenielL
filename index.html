                  In 5 years this is what I envision.
                  I want to be a future software engineer to be honest.
                  It is not a clear goal though as I still am finding what I enjoy 
                  because that is what matters for me when I'm working.
                  I want to be in a position where I am able to provide for 
                  my family and everyone related to me if they need it.
                  I do not want to sacrifice my time doing something I do not enjoy with jobs.
                  I want to be able to be in a place to work on projects that I am passionate about,
                  to be honest PC Hardware and Software Maintenance is what I enjoy the most.
                  But still IT Department is still a good place to start in my opinion.
                  The teachings of your subject was frightening at first but it really made me 
                  feel like I am learning with you as the professor. 
                  It was nerve-wracking for the past few months as you've been teaching
                  but it really set us straight in my opinion, Me and the whole class think
                  that you are an exceptional teacher and I am very grateful to you.
